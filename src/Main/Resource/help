Welcome to replicator
Replicator is a program to make a unique NPC's and their speeches
It uses personID to create a path to text files with other information about this person
Every command uses different amount of arguments otherwise uses unified format
Example: read:-1:1 - read speech with id 1 of person with id -1.
To more information about commands write 'commands'
Be careful when you gonna delete speech manually you can break speechID sequence
To avoid confusion of the id sequences you should not make a speeches for primitive id's
